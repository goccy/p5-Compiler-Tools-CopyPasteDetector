=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Exception::Interface - Role defining the interface for Catalyst exceptions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   package My::Catalyst::Like::Exception;
   use Moose;
   use namespace::clean -except => 'meta';

   with 'Catalyst::Exception::Interface';

   # This comprises the required interface.
   sub as_string { 'the exception text for stringification' }
   sub throw { shift; die @_ }
   sub rethrow { shift; die @_ }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a role for the required interface for Catalyst exceptions.

It ensures that all exceptions follow the expected interface,
and adds overloading for stringification when composed onto a
class.

Note that if you compose this role onto another role, that role
must use L<MooseX::Role::WithOverloading>.
