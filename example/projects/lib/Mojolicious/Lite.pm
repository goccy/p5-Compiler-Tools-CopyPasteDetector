=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Lite - Real-time micro web framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Automatically enables "strict", "warnings" and Perl 5.10 features
  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Route with placeholder
  get '/:foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $foo  = $self->param('foo');
    $self->render(text => "Hello from $foo.");
  };

  # Start the Mojolicious command system
  app->start;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Lite> is a micro real-time web framework built around
L<Mojolicious>.

=head1 TUTORIAL

A quick example driven introduction to the wonders of L<Mojolicious::Lite>.
Most of what you'll learn here also applies to normal L<Mojolicious>
applications.

=head2 Hello World

A simple Hello World application can look like this, L<strict>, L<warnings>
and Perl 5.10 features are automatically enabled and a few functions imported
when you use L<Mojolicious::Lite>, turning your script into a full featured
web application.

  #!/usr/bin/env perl
  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Hello World!');
  };

  app->start;

=head2 Generator

There is also a helper command to generate a small example application.

  $ mojo generate lite_app

=head2 Commands

All the normal L<Mojolicious::Commands> are available from the command line.
Note that CGI and PSGI environments can usually be auto detected and will
just work without commands.

  $ ./myapp.pl daemon
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

  $ ./myapp.pl daemon -l http://*:8080
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

  $ ./myapp.pl cgi
  ...CGI output...

  $ ./myapp.pl
  ...List of available commands (or automatically detected environment)...

=head2 Start

The app->start call that starts the L<Mojolicious> command system can be
customized to override normal C<@ARGV> use.

  app->start('cgi');

=head2 Reloading

Your application will automatically reload itself if you start it with the
C<morbo> development web server, so you don't have to restart the server
after every change.

  $ morbo myapp.pl
  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

=head2 Routes

Routes are basically just fancy paths that can contain different kinds of
placeholders. C<$self> is an instance of L<Mojolicious::Controller>
containing both the HTTP request and response.

  # /foo
  get '/foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Hello World!');
  };

=head2 GET/POST parameters

All C<GET> and C<POST> parameters are accessible via C<param>.

  # /foo?user=sri
  get '/foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $user = $self->param('user');
    $self->render(text => "Hello $user.");
  };

=head2 Stash and templates

The C<stash> is used to pass data to templates, which can be inlined in the
C<DATA> section.

  # /bar
  get '/bar' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->stash(one => 23);
    $self->render('baz', two => 24);
  };

  __DATA__

  @@ baz.html.ep
  The magic numbers are <%= $one %> and <%= $two %>.

For more information about templates see also
L<Mojolicious::Guides::Rendering/"Embedded Perl">.

=head2 HTTP

L<Mojo::Message::Request> and L<Mojo::Message::Response> give you full access
to all HTTP features and information.

  # /agent
  get '/agent' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->res->headers->header('X-Bender' => 'Bite my shiny metal ass!');
    $self->render(text => $self->req->headers->user_agent);
  };

=head2 Route names

All routes can have a name associated with them, this allows automatic
template detection and back referencing with C<url_for>, C<link_to> and
C<form_for>. Nameless routes get an automatically generated one assigned that
is simply equal to the route itself without non-word characters.

  # /
  get '/' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render;
  } => 'index';

  # /hello
  get '/hello';

  __DATA__

  @@ index.html.ep
  <%= link_to Hello  => 'hello' %>.
  <%= link_to Reload => 'index' %>.

  @@ hello.html.ep

=head2 Layouts

Templates can have layouts.

  # /with_layout
  get '/with_layout' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render('with_layout');
  };

  __DATA__

    <body><%= content %></body>
  </html>

=head2 Blocks

Template blocks can be used like normal Perl functions and are always
delimited by the C<begin> and C<end> keywords.

  # /with_block
  get '/with_block' => 'block';

  __DATA__

  @@ block.html.ep

=head2 Captured content

The C<content_for> helper can be used to pass around blocks of captured
content.

  # /captured
  get '/captured' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render('captured');
  };

=head2 Helpers

You can also extend L<Mojolicious> with your own helpers, a list of all
built-in ones can be found in L<Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers> and
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::TagHelpers>.

  # "whois" helper
  helper whois => sub {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $agent = $self->req->headers->user_agent || 'Anonymous';
    my $ip    = $self->tx->remote_address;
    return "$agent ($ip)";
  };

  # /secret
  get '/secret' => sub {

    $self->app->log->debug("Request from $user.");
  };

  __DATA__

  @@ secret.html.ep

=head2 Placeholders

Route placeholders allow capturing parts of a request path until a C</> or
C<.> separator occurs, results will be stored by name in the C<stash> and
C<param>.

  # /foo/test
  # /foo/test123
  get '/foo/:bar' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $bar  = $self->stash('bar');
    $self->render(text => "Our :bar placeholder matched $bar");
  };

  # /testsomething/foo
  # /test123something/foo
  get '/(:bar)something/foo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $bar  = $self->param('bar');
    $self->render(text => "Our :bar placeholder matched $bar");
  };

=head2 Wildcard placeholders

Wildcard placeholders allow matching absolutely everything, including
C</> and C<.>.

  # /hello/test
  # /hello/test123
  # /hello/test.123/test/123
  get '/hello/*you' => 'groovy';

  __DATA__

  @@ groovy.html.ep
  Your name is <%= $you %>.

=head2 HTTP methods

Routes can be restricted to specific request methods.

  # GET /bye
  get '/bye' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Bye.');
  };

  # POST /bye
  post '/bye' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Bye.');
  };

  # GET|POST|DELETE /bye
  any ['get', 'post', 'delete'] => '/bye' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Bye.');
  };

  # * /baz
  any '/baz' => sub {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $method = $self->req->method;
    $self->render(text => "You called /baz with $method");
  };

=head2 Optional placeholders

Routes allow default values to make placeholders optional.

  # /hello
  # /hello/Sara
  get '/hello/:name' => {name => 'Sebastian'} => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render('groovy', format => 'txt');
  };

  __DATA__

  @@ groovy.txt.ep
  My name is <%= $name %>.

=head2 Restrictive placeholders

The easiest way to make placeholders more restrictive are alternatives, you
just make a list of possible values.

  # /test
  # /123
  any '/:foo' => [foo => ['test', 123]] => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $foo  = $self->param('foo');
    $self->render(text => "Our :foo placeholder matched $foo");
  };

All placeholders get compiled to a regex internally, this process can also be
easily customized.

  # /1
  # /123
  any '/:bar' => [bar => qr/\d+/] => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $bar  = $self->param('bar');
    $self->render(text => "Our :bar placeholder matched $bar");
  };

Just make sure not to use C<^> and C<$> or capturing groups C<(...)>, because
placeholders become part of a larger regular expression internally,
C<(?:...)> is fine though.

=head2 Formats

Formats can be automatically detected by looking at file extensions.

  # /detection.html
  # /detection.txt
  get '/detection' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render('detected');
  };

  __DATA__

  @@ detected.html.ep
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head><title>Detected</title></head>
    <body>HTML was detected.</body>
  </html>

  @@ detected.txt.ep
  TXT was detected.

Restrictive placeholders can also be used for format detection.

  # /hello.json
  # /hello.txt
  get '/hello' => [format => ['json', 'txt']] => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->render_json({hello => 'world'})
      if $self->stash('format') eq 'json';
    $self->render_text('hello world');
  };

=head2 Content negotiation

For resources with different representations and that require truly
C<RESTful> content negotiation you can also use C<respond_to>.

  # /hello (Accept: application/json)
  # /hello (Accept: text/xml)
  # /hello.json
  # /hello.xml
  # /hello?format=json
  # /hello?format=xml
  get '/hello' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->respond_to(
      json => {json => {hello => 'world'}},
      xml  => {text => '<hello>world</hello>'},
      any  => {data => '', status => 204}
    );
  };

MIME type mappings can be extended or changed easily with
L<Mojolicious/"types">.

  app->types->type(rdf => 'application/rdf+xml');

=head2 Under

Authentication and code shared between multiple routes can be realized easily
with the C<under> statement. All following routes are only evaluated if the
C<under> callback returned a true value.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Authenticate based on name parameter
  under sub {
    my $self = shift;

    # Authenticated
    my $name = $self->param('name') || '';
    return 1 if $name eq 'Bender';

    # Not authenticated
    $self->render('denied');
    return;
  };

  # / (with authentication)
  get '/' => 'index';

  app->start;
  __DATA__;

  @@ denied.html.ep
  You are not Bender, permission denied.

  @@ index.html.ep
  Hi Bender.

Prefixing multiple routes is another good use for C<under>.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # /foo
  under '/foo';

  # /foo/bar
  get '/bar' => {text => 'foo bar'};

  # /foo/baz
  get '/baz' => {text => 'foo baz'};

  # /
  under '/' => {message => 'whatever'};

  # /bar
  get '/bar' => {inline => '<%= $message %> works'};

  app->start;

You can also C<group> related routes, which allows nesting of multiple
C<under> statements.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  # Global logic shared by all routes
  under sub {
    my $self = shift;
    return 1 if $self->req->headers->header('X-Bender');
    $self->render(text => "You're not Bender.");
    return;
  };

  # Admin section
  group {

    # Local logic shared only by routes in this group
    under '/admin' => sub {
      my $self = shift;
      return 1 if $self->req->heaers->header('X-Awesome');
      $self->render(text => "You're not awesome enough.");
      return;
    };

    # GET /admin/dashboard
    get '/dashboard' => {text => 'Nothing to see here yet.'};
  };

  # GET /welcome
  get '/welcome' => {text => 'Hi Bender.'};

  app->start;

=head2 Conditions

Conditions such as C<agent> and C<host> from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::HeaderCondition> allow even more powerful route
constructs.

  # /foo (Firefox)
  get '/foo' => (agent => qr/Firefox/) => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Congratulations, you are using a cool browser.');
  };

  # /foo (Internet Explorer)
  get '/foo' => (agent => qr/Internet Explorer/) => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Dude, you really need to upgrade to Firefox.');
  };

  # http://mojolicio.us/bar
  get '/bar' => (host => 'mojolicio.us') => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'Hello Mojolicious.');
  };

=head2 Sessions

Signed cookie based sessions just work out of the box as soon as you start
using them.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/counter' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->session->{counter}++;
  };

  app->start;
  __DATA__

  @@ counter.html.ep
  Counter: <%= session 'counter' %>

=head2 Secret

Note that you should use a custom C<secret> to make signed cookies really
secure.

  app->secret('My secret passphrase here');

=head2 File uploads

All files uploaded via C<multipart/form-data> request are automatically
available as L<Mojo::Upload> instances. And you don't have to worry about
memory usage, because all files above C<250KB> will be automatically streamed
into a temporary file.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  any '/upload' => sub {
    my $self = shift;

    # Check file size
    return $self->render(text => 'File is too big.', status => 200)
      if $self->req->is_limit_exceeded;

    # Process uploaded file
    if (my $example = $self->req->upload('example')) {
      my $size = $example->size;
      my $name = $example->filename;
      $self->render(text => "Thanks for uploading $size byte file $name.");
    }
  };

  app->start;
  __DATA__

        %= submit_button 'Upload'
      % end

  </html>

To protect you from excessively large files there is also a limit of C<5MB>
by default, which you can tweak with the C<MOJO_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE> environment
variable.

  # Increase limit to 1GB
  $ENV{MOJO_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE} = 1073741824;

=head2 User agent

With L<Mojo::UserAgent> there's a full featured HTTP 1.1 and WebSocket user
agent built right in. Especially in combination with L<Mojo::JSON> and
L<Mojo::DOM> this can be a very powerful tool.

  get '/test' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(data => $self->ua->get('http://mojolicio.us')->res->body);
  };

=head2 WebSockets

WebSocket applications have never been this easy before.

  websocket '/echo' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->on(message => sub {
      my ($self, $message) = @_;
      $self->send_message("echo: $message");
    });
  };

The C<message> event will be emitted for every new WebSocket message that is
received.

=head2 External templates

External templates will be searched by the renderer in a C<templates>
directory.

  # /external
  any '/external' => sub {
    my $self = shift;

    # templates/foo/bar.html.ep
    $self->render('foo/bar');
  };

=head2 Static files

Static files will be automatically served from the C<DATA> section
(even Base64 encoded) or a C<public> directory if it exists.

  @@ something.js
  alert('hello!');

  @@ test.txt (base64)
  dGVzdCAxMjMKbGFsYWxh

  $ mkdir public
  $ mv something.js public/something.js

=head2 Testing

Testing your application is as easy as creating a C<t> directory and filling
it with normal Perl unit tests.

  use Test::More tests => 3;
  use Test::Mojo;

  use FindBin;
  require "$FindBin::Bin/../myapp.pl";

  my $t = Test::Mojo->new;
  $t->get_ok('/')->status_is(200)->content_like(qr/Funky/);

Run all unit tests with the C<test> command.

  $ ./myapp.pl test

To make your tests more noisy and show you all log messages you can also
change the application log level directly in your test files.

  $t->app->log->level('debug');

=head2 Mode

To disable debug messages later in a production setup you can change the
L<Mojolicious> mode, default will be C<development>.

  $ ./myapp.pl -m production

=head2 Logging

L<Mojo::Log> messages will be automatically written to C<STDERR> or a
C<log/$mode.log> file if a C<log> directory exists.

  $ mkdir log

For more control the L<Mojolicious> instance can be accessed directly.

  app->log->level('error');
  app->routes->route('/foo/:bar')->via('GET')->to(cb => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->app->log->debug('Got a request for "Hello Mojo!".');
    $self->render(text => 'Hello Mojo!');
  });

=head2 Growing

In case a lite app needs to grow, lite and real L<Mojolicious> applications
can be easily mixed to make the transition process very smooth.

  package MyApp::Foo;
  use Mojo::Base 'Mojolicious::Controller';

  sub index {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'It works.');
  }

  package main;
  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  get '/bar' => sub {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->render(text => 'This too.');
  };

  app->routes->namespace('MyApp');
  app->routes->route('/foo/:action')->via('GET')->to('foo#index');

  app->start;

There is also a helper command to generate a full L<Mojolicious> example that
will let you explore the astonishing similarities between
L<Mojolicious::Lite> and L<Mojolicious> applications. Both share about 99% of
the same code, so almost everything you learned in this tutorial applies
there too. :)

  $ mojo generate app
